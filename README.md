# Urban Trees

This is a project demonstrating a scroll technique similar to [this site](https://www.chelseacollective.com/).

## Project Requirements

- The container titled “scene” should be replaced with different content (urban or trees)
- This action must be triggered by mouse wheel scroll or up / down arrow keys
- Address bar must reflect the change in location (www.domain.com/trees, www.domain/urban) and visiting these URLs should bounce the user to that location
- Page title must reflect the change in location ("Urban" or "Trees")
- Forward and back buttons must work successfully
- Header and footer sections must remain constant through the user journey

## Stretch Goals

- Layout changes
- CSS or JS driven animations between location transitions
